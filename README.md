# Bounty - Multimedia Application

## About This Bounty

This bounty is based on Multimedia Application of the Web Development with React campaign which is released on the same day, and you are expected to use the project created in the Multimedia Application quest as your base files.

In the Multimedia Application quest, we built a web app that allowed one to rename and delete any of the six files present. Your task is to build two more features that you think best fit the overall function of the web app.

From a user's perspective, think of two features that a user will greatly appreciate when using this web app. You can also ask your friends to use the web app that you built in the Multimedia Application quest and survey what they think should be added.

Once you are done building, you should proceed to upload your completed web app on any web hosting service such as Firebase, Vercel or Netlify.

You should also ensure that your site's source files are uploaded onto a GitHub repository as this will need to be submitted.

You will also need to provide a write-up of at least one hundred words. This write-up will consist of the following details:
A description of the two features you built and how they work
An explanation of why you chose these two features and why you think they are appropriate additions to the Multimedia Web App.
An explanation of how your code works

The write-up can be either a PDF file or Markdown file. You should ensure that the file can be accessed by our reviewer.

See the Guidelines below for what is required for your submission.

## Acceptance Criteria

The 10 most deserving submissions will be rewarded USD 15. Submissions will be judged based on the following criteria:
1. Appropriateness of the two features: Do the new features built fit in with the rest of the functions of the multimedia web app?
1. Creativity of the two features: Are the new features innovative and stand out from other submitted features?
1. Comprehensiveness of the write-up: Does the write-up clearly explain why the two features were built and how they work?
1. Code Quality: Does the code follow the best coding practices and is easy for other developments to understand?
